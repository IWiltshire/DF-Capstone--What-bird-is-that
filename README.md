# DF-Capstone--What bird is that
 The goal of this project was to create a method for users to identify common UK birds based on their visual recollections of the animal. In order to accomplish this, I scraped species information from the RSPB website and used a machine learning algorithm to construct a classification model. Afterwards, I made a function that takes in user inputs, feeds them into the model, and then outputs the three likeliest species of bird based on the input.
 The entire project was completed in Python.
